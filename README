This code was used in the following way:

A_processing_gencode:
    Process GENCODE v45 to extract coordinates for 5' UTRs
    and the first 6bp of the CDS, up to a limit of 250nt.

    The files produced by 4_make_df_coordinates_ukb.R and
    5_make_df_coordinates_6bp_ukb.R were used to extract
    UKB variants using DNA nexus.

    Scripts:
      - 1_clean_up_gencode_gene_ann.R
      - 2_clean_up_gencode_transcripts.R
      - 3_make_5utr_ref_df.R
      - 4_make_df_coordinates_ukb.R
      - 5_make_df_coordinates_6bp_ukb.R

    (All code was run on Sherlock, Stanford's computing cluster)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

B_processing_UKB_WGS_variants:
    Process UKB variants extracted from DNA Nexus from the
    500K WGS data release in December 2023.

    The key files produced by this set of scripts are
    UKB_observed_variants_annotated.csv and
    UKB_invariant_variants_annotated_top40hs_AR.csv, which are
    then used to produce the final panel.

    Scripts:
      - 1_combine_ukb_variants_all.R
      - 2_annotate_ukb_variants.R
      - 3_make_invariant_sites.R
      - 4_combine_chr_files.R

    (All code was run on Sherlock, Stanford's computing cluster)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

C_make_1M_panel:
    Filtering of UKB variants and strategic selection of a panel
    of 1M variants for NaP-TRAP.

    Scripts:
      - panel_design_FINAL.R

    (Note that this code was run locally.)
